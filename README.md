## Project Overview  
This project showcases an **end-to-end real-time data pipeline** built with the **Modern Data Stack**.  
It captures **live stock market data** from an external API, streams it in real time, orchestrates data transformations, and delivers analytics-ready insights â€” all within a unified framework.  

Special thanks to **[Jay](https://github.com/Jay61616/real-time-stocks-mds/tree/main)** for his guidance and the foundational work. Parts of the code and pipeline design were adapted from his original project.
